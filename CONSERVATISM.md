# Conservatism
_As explained by conservatives._

## Chesterton's Fence

> In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them,
there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably
be called a paradox.  There exists in such a case a certain institution
or law; let us say for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected
across a road.  The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it
and says, "I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away."
To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer:
"If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away.
Go away and think.  Then, when you can come back and tell me that you
do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."

---G. K. Chesterton, _The Thing_, 1929
